The following directory contains following files and folders.




## Files
The folder contains Three code files which are as follows:

1. AI4EO_Assgn. 2_Q1.ipynb: It contains code for the model training for Q1.

2. q2.py: It contains code to generate the labels for test data labels not provided for Q2.

3. AI4EO_Assgn. 2_Q3.ipynb: It contains code to create noisy labels and train the model on it for Q3.

All the code files are inline throughly commented for the reviewer.


## Folders

assignment2Data - It contains the following subfolders:

1. trainingLabeled: It contains files for training dataset in  time1 and time2 timestamps along with label.

2. testKnownLabel: It contains files for test dataset in  time1 and time2 timestamps along with label.

3. testLabelNotProvided: It contains test dataset with time1 and time2 timestamps along with the 'cdPredictions' folder containing Change detection Labels generated by the model.

4. trainingLabeledNoisy: It contains noisy flipped labels from the training dataset in 'label' folder along with the training dataset in  time1 and time2 timestamps.

5. Q1: Folder containing Q1 code.

6. Q2: Folder containing Q2 code and files.

7. Q3: Folder containing Q3 code and files.
